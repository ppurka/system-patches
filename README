    its behavior.
    Earlier behavior -

        click on taskbar window shows all open windows of same class,
        double click on taskbar window minimizes application
    New behavior -
        middle click on taskbar shows windows from same class,
        click on taskbar window focuses/minimizes application
        double click on taskbar window is not bound to anything, so it
        cycles through a focus and minimize of the window.
